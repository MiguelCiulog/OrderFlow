**Project: Real-Time Order Processing System**

**Inspiration:**
I had previously created a system about a greenhouse temperature/humidity maintainer.
Messaging queues got me interested and I went to ChatGPT to generate a random "problem" that would require the use of messaging queues.

**Why Typescript/Javascript?**
Although I have had previous knowledge using Javascript and did not enjoy it very much in monolithic solutions, there is a small part of me that wants to know if typescript really is the best of both worlds.

**Description:**
Create a real-time order processing system for an e-commerce platform where incoming orders are processed and updated in real-time. This system would be responsible for handling a high volume of orders efficiently, ensuring order updates are processed in a timely manner, and providing real-time order status updates to customers.

**Why a Messaging Queue is Needed:**
To handle a large number of incoming orders and process them in real-time, a messaging queue is essential. It helps decouple the order submission from order processing, ensuring that orders are not lost or delayed during high traffic periods. The messaging queue can be used to distribute orders to multiple worker processes or microservices responsible for order processing.

**Key Components:**
1. **Order Submission Endpoint:** This is where customers place orders on the e-commerce platform. When a new order is submitted, it's sent to the messaging queue for further processing.

2. **Messaging Queue:** The messaging queue acts as an intermediate buffer where incoming orders are placed. It ensures that orders are processed in the order they were received and distributed to multiple worker processes or microservices.

3. **Order Processing Microservices:** These microservices are responsible for order processing tasks such as **"payment processing"**, **inventory management**,  and **generating order status updates**. Each microservice listens to the messaging queue for new orders and processes them independently.

4. **Database:** Store order and customer data in a database. The database is updated with the status of orders as they are processed.

5. **Authentication System:** Create an authentication middleware system that is decoupled from the backend main system, it should act somewhat as a proxy server in case there needs to be another subsystem.

**Additional Features/ Not the main focus:**
- Real-Time Order Status Updates: Implement real-time communication between the backend system and the frontend to provide customers with instant order status updates. Use WebSockets or a similar technology to push updates to the customer's interface.
- Error handling and retry mechanisms to handle failed order processing.
- Dashboard for administrators to monitor the order processing system, track order status.
- Integration with external payment gateways, inventory systems, and shipping providers.
